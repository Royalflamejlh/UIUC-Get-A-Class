## Automatically register for a Class at University of Illinois via Self Service Emails

### I used this in 2022! It may not work anymore! 

You will need to set up a chrome driver for selenium, and adjust scripts to your personal email or class configuration

The web page layouts may have changed over the years so before setting it up step through all the pages and make sure everything works

What I did was go into the mycourses and set up class sections to email when a spot became available, then the script on recieving the email will go into self service and attempt to register for that class.

### DO NOT SPAM REGISTRATIONS, YOU CAN LOSE YOUR ONLINE REGISTRATION PRIVILEGE

This script was written to avoid spamming self service with requests, you put yourself at risk of having to register in person if you send too many requests!
